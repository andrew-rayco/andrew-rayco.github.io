        <h1>Self Confidence</h1>
        <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>

        <p>They are the same. It's an inner knowledge. You can't be mindful without being self-aware and vice-versa.</p>

        <h3>Try Body Scan and Journaling. What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
        <p>I really enjoyed the body scan. In the Headspace mediation sessions, we scan the body every time, but I always found it too difficult. Too broad. So I'd flitter all over just focusing on the standout areas. This method of the body scan was more specific. I learned something about myself today, that I really do better with pretty specific task requirements. I mean I guess I always had a strong dislike for ambiguity, so maybe I didn't learn it today, but also I feel like I kinda did? I don't know. This is weird, but great.</p>
        <p>I tried the journaling. I've tried it before and it was very therapeutic for me when I broke up with my first love. I didn't have much success 'letting go' in the exercise today. It felt too forced and everything I wrote was surface-level dribble. Also, does it have to be handwriting? I'm a lot quicker if I type it (and it's actually legible). I get that it's more real and earthy and honest if it's handwritten.</p>

        <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
        <p>To be honest it's not something I'd thought about before. To be sure, I tend to say "I am sad" as opposed to "my body is experiencing the phsysiological effects of sadness", so it's certainly a new concept to me and one that I'll take on board. I'm doing a lot of taking on board lately, and I'm really enjoying it. Really.</p>
