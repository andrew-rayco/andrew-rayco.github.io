      <h3>My feature wishlist</h3>
      <p>I love the hover nav feature in the <a href="http://1700laposte.com/mythologies/accueil">1700 la poste</a> site where each nav has a unique colour associated with it and that colour is reflected elsewhere on the page when you hover over the nav item.</p>
      <p>For a long time I've loved the ever-changing colours on the <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/16/">2016 Webstock</a> site. Would that I had the design skills necessary to implement that so effectively. For now, I've just added the keyframe animation to the background body colour.</p>
      <p>Since it seems we'll be adding more and more pages to our blog, I'd like a more scalable nav. I'm thinking something with a JavaScript toggle like Thomasin has on her blog. I just haven't figured out the way I want to do it yet.</p>
      <p>Another nav feature that I'd like to implement (but don't really want on my blog site for now) is a sticky header that stays at the top of the browser window when you scroll down.</p>

      <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
      <p>Thanks to Udacity I can't think of an analogy beyond the house (HTML being the structure and CSS the decoration). So I googled for a more interesting analogy and I found <a href="https://mkpn.io/2013/the-big-green-ball-analogy/">The Big Green Ball Analogy</a>. Although it's for HTML, CSS and JavaScript, it's a pretty great way of simplifying it.</p>
      <p><strong>The big green ball bounces when I drop it:</strong><br>
        The HTML is the ball, it's just a ball. Until we use CSS to make it big and green. JavaScript makes the ball bounce, but only when I drop it.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt>
        <dd>The HTML is the pure content, what your website <em>says</em>. It should be presented semantically, that is, where content elements are marked up according to their importance (e.g. Headings and paragraphs), or type of content (e.g. lists and images).</dd>
        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>The CSS is the presentation, how your website <em>looks</em>. Colours, typography, borders etc.</dd>
        <dt>The DOM</dt>
        <dd>The DOM (Document Object Model) is a little trickier to define. It's a tree-like structure (the model) of the current document where each element within is represented by a node (like a person in a family tree), and how they are all related. The DOM can be manipulated by JavaScript.</dd>

      <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
      <p>Essentially boxifying is to break down a design into small boxes, each representing a specific element on the page. All websites are structurally built from boxes that together form a grid.</p>

      <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
      <p>The Box Model defines the ultimate size of a box by calculating each of the four elements. From inside out, the elements are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>content</li>
          <li>padding</li>
          <li>border</li>
          <li>margin</li>
        </ul>
