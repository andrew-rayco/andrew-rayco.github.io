      <h3>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>The timeboxing really saved me with that rad typing game. The pomodoro technique (which is currently ticking away) for time management.</p>
      <p>For habit techniques, I've embraced the four questions, and I intend to start a tiny habit using the Fogg method as soon as I come up with one that isn't just flossing.</p>

      <h3>what did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>I found the habit forming content the most interesting. Not least because I feel it's something I could really benefit from. In my past the only habit I've formed with habit forming techniques is consistently failing to keep up the habit.</p>

      <h3>what worked for you?</h3>
      <p>I find the pomodoro technique most helpful. It can however be a little distracting when the timer goes off mid-thought. Or worse, when I see there's only a minute left so I get the old 'better hurry up and finish this thing before the time runs out oh look I'm paying more attention to the timer than the material' situation.</p>

      <h3>which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>I intend to give the four questions are real go. Let's see how it works out. In the last year I've also dabbled in mindfulness meditation. I hope to pick up that again more routinely.</p>
