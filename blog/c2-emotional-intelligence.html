      <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>I learned that emotional competencies are something you can deliberately acquire with practice. I was as surprised as the author about what emotional skills are effective in the military.</p>
      <p>Happiness as a skill that can be trained is very appealing to me. I ponder all too often on happiness.</p>
      <p>The physiological connection with emotion was not a revelation, but that the physiological signs could be evident well ahead of the emotion raised my brows somewhat.</p>

      <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>I have been practicing mindfulness meditation for a couple of weeks now, so instead of 2 minutes I did 15 minutes of Headspace. There are days where it feels amazing and that something is really happening, and other days where it just chills me out. I appreciated both but prefer the former as it feels like I'm growing my skills. Today was the latter. </p>
