        <h1>Design to the web</h1>
        <h3>What is a responsive site is, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>With so many web-accessible devices, there is a great variety of screen sizes. Where once a site was developed for just a single size, now a site needs to respond to best make use of the available screen real estate.</p>
        <p>A responsive site will optimise the content, design and legibility for the given display to ensure the user enjoys a satisfactory experience.</p>

        <h3>What is mobile first design, and why is it important?</h3>
        <p>Mobile first design is where a site or app is first designed and built for small devices, and then progressive enhancement is applied at larger breakpoints to exploit greater screen space.</p>
        <p>Typically, mobile first design forces a development team to identify the key elements of content and strip away anything absolutely unnecessary until there is the screen space to accommodate it. Additionally, writing styles mobile first ensures the smaller devices (that tend to have less processing power) only need process the bare minimum styles, saving any additional features and styles for machines with greater screen space (and power).</p>

        <h3>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons</h3>
        <p>Frameworks are kits of pre-written code that are useful for implementing common challenges that one might find when developing sites or apps. Frameworks aim to save time and ensure a certain level of consistency, reducing the work required in development.</p>
        <p>I mentioned the pros above. Time saving and consistency. Cons to using frameworks are that you rarely use all the functionality of the framework, so there's likely to be some code adding weight to your site unnecessarily. Something else that might be considered a con is that you don't necessarily know a framework as intimately as you might know something you have built yourself from scratch. As a result you might not have as good an understanding of how your project works as you could.</p>

        <h3>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h3>
        <p>A wireframe is a high-level structural diagram that lays out where the key elements of the page are to be positioned. It's not a design so much as a blueprint. This gives the developer a plan to work off when setting up the foundations of the site without getting prematurely bogged down in design elements.</p>
