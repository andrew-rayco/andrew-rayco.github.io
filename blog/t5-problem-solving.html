        <h1>Problem Solving</h1>

        <h3>Hello Friend</h3>
        <p>Let me tell you about a time I got blocked on simple problem, but solved the problem in an elegant way.</p>
        <p>Let me start off by making it clear that I don't believe for a second that my solution was elegant. In fact, far from it I'm sure. Could I be excused if I said that the problem was solved, and I just happened to be resplendent in a glorious, yet refined, ball gown at the time?</p>
        <p>"I'm sure your solution was elegant, Andrew, don't be so hard on yourself" I hear you say. You'll just have to trust me, because I came across the solution after abandoning all hope that I'd be the one to solve it.</p>

        <h3>You probably know it</h3>
        <p>It was the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#h_5Hz2kiaaXp">Chess board</a> challenge from the <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> book.</p>
        <p>I own that book. I've read that chapter twice before. The first time online, the second time was after I bought the book knowing full well that I struggle to read anything of length online. My mind is too ready to flutter off elsewhere. I've done the chess board exercise before, but I couldn't remember how I did it or how easy/hard I found it.</p>
        <p>This time I found it HARD. Not how to code it so much as how to solve it. Pseudocode was no use to me because I couldn't nut it out (without having two long strings of spaces and checkers in an if/else statement. Trying something was a failure at the start because I didn't know where to. Loops within loops, I learned, after reluctantly resorting to the hidden exercise hints. Loops within loops was how to go about it. I find it gets pretty tough to keep track of with loops in loops.</p>
        <p>I solved it. Inelegantly I'm sure, but it worked. I had to step through the loops with debugging, and console.log the guts out of the string I was building, but I found that whole exercise a bit of a kick in the joy. Everything was going so smoothly before that.</p>
        <p>It's such a strange thing that happens in your mind when you expect to see a certain output from your code and you see something completely different. There's a real panic flavour to it. That question about this as a career choice returns. The self-doubt looms heavier. Isn't it funny how self-doubt seems so self-assured about itself? Self-doubt seems so much easier to believe than self-belief. Self-doubt is convinced it is fact. Self-believe feels like a wishlist that'll never come true. It's a hard thing to change about yourself, that's for sure.</p>

        <h3>I was asked about how I felt about other thus far unmentioned problem solving methods</h3>
        <p>The rubber ducky method is difficult for me because I'm all internal. One of the things I most hope to get out of this bootcamp is a sizable improvement in my code-communication skills. I've been doing it for so long alone that talking about it seems like a scary, unfamiliar man standing motionless in my yard in the small hours. Not something I want to approach, but something I know I have to. Anyway, didn't have any luck with the duck.</p>
        <p>Reading error messages. I do that, of course when I encounter them. They're essential when I understand them. Infuriating when I don't.</p>
        <p>Googling. I do plenty of that and on a regular basis too. We're lucky to be studying in a field where it's possible to do that effectively. But just when to google? That's what I struggle with. Do I solve it myself or google it straight away? Which one makes me a better developer? There's some middle ground between 'straight away' and 'after hours of impasse after impasse'. Finding that is the what counts. Also about google, I don't like it when I find a solution to my problem but I still don't understand it. What do I do? Copy the code chunk and throw it in my project? Suddenly I loose all intimacy with the build. I can't trust it anymore because I don't know entirely what's going on. Anyway, I google like a banshee.</p>
        <p>Asking peers or coaches for help. Haven't tried that yet. Not sure if that's because of lack of people to ask, or lack of willingness to. I have a strong need to learn things myself. Something I have to be careful with, lest I miss opportunities to progress.</p>
        <p>I have no doubt about the effectiveness of reflection, though I do have doubts about my ability to effectively reflect. Not only do I often forget to do it, I'm not even sure I'm doing it right when I do.</p>

        <h3>So you want to know about the map, filter and reduce methods huh?</h3>
        <p>Take a number, pal.</p>
        <p>The <code>map()</code> method iterates through an array and processes them each item through a given function and returns a new array.</p>
        <p>The <code>filter()</code> method iterates through an array and processes each item through a given function. A new array is returned with only the items that return true from the given function.</p>
        <p>The <code>reduce()</code> method reduces the array to a single value by passing each item through a function where a calculation is performed. This method can take three arguments: An accumulator (to keep the total), currentValue (the item currently being acted on), and currentIndex (the index of the item currently being acted on).</p>
