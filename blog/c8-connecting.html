        <h1>Connecting</h1>

        <h3>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
        <p>I certainly haven't tried these techniques knowingly, but it's something that I've done in the past naturally. Truthfully, I believe I only tend to be sincere, kind and open with those that I immediately find myself liking. I have never tried such an exercise (knowingly or unknowingly) on someone that I didn't immediately connect with. One would assume that situation is the exact time when this exercise might bear fruit, but I haven't had the opportunity to try it yet. It does involve a certain amount of vulnerability I expect, and I promised myself I would embrace vulnerability during the EDA bootcamp (and hopefully afterwards and onwards).</p>

        <h3>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h3>
        <p>I found it similar to the mindfulness listening exercise. Though I was certainly more mindful of trying to detect emotions more than listening to just the words, so I guess it helped somewhat. I've always found myself to have a lot of empathy, and this chapter has reinforced that. At the risk of appearing unpleasantly cocky, much of this chapter felt like common sense to me, as I tend to already operate being mindful of how other people might be feeling. Mostly. Sometimes.</p>

        <h3>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h3>
        <p>Now this I really enjoyed. I'll admit, there are times during this book and its exercises that some cynicism rises within me. If things sound more flower power there's a cautious part of me that warns me not to believe it. Thing is, I want to believe it and I like it. This exercise really felt good. I was reminded that I have no-one in my life currently who is making my life difficult, and it felt really nice to have and project these warm thoughts to myself and others.</p>

        <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</h3>
        <p>In a previous job it was my role to filter potential clients and select projects that would be best for the organisation.</p>
        <p>My view: On one occasion I felt I had found a perfect project for us. It had a healthy budget, a reasonable timeframe and most importantly, the client and project shared our organisational values. Furthermore, our client-base was thinning because we were taking on bigger projects and we were becoming more and more dependant on our key client, with their demands on our resources ever-growing. I had genuine concerns that there was too great a risk putting all/most our eggs in the one basket. The Directors, much to my disappointment, seemed immediately disinterested and were unwilling to consider putting our foot forward for the new project.</p>
        <p>Their view: Andrew's suggested project has some appeal, but we feel our pipeline is already too full with upcoming work. We share his concerns regarding dependence on our key client, but he isn't in the room when we are planning with them so can't possibly understand the working relationship we share. We enjoy the security we get from a large key client, along with the reduction in management workload dealing with fewer clients.</p>
