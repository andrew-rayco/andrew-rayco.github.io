        <h1>Leadership</h1>
        <h3>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h3>
        <p>I've been fortunate/unfortunate enough to experience both compassionate and imcompassionate (sic?) leadership in the workplace.</p>
        <p>I'll speak of the compassionate leadership, because I suspect most everyone has experience in the opposite. I've been very lucky to work in a place run by genuinely warm, compassionate leaders. I can honestly say that it inspired me to perform better (albeit not faultlessly) than I otherwise might have. When you consider your leaders to also be your friends, not only do you want to do well for them but - and perhaps even moreso - you find yourself struggling hard against letting them down, and being disappointed in yourself when you inevitably do.</p>

        <h3>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
        <p>This was one of those exercises where I had some initial skepticism, but darned if I didn't really enjoy this one too. It was easy, and it felt surprisingly nice. I can truly see benefits in doing this every day.</p>

        <h3>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</h3>
        <p>I found this one a little harder. Largely because I couldn't really home in on any targets with negative energy that I could visualise myself converting. I scraped through with some examples, but didn't really 'gel' with the concept as well as I feel I should have.</p>

        <h3>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>In a bid to make my life easier, I'm going to break SCARF down to best answer this question.</p>
        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Status</strong> - I'd be lying if I said I haven't struggled with the idea of status during Phase 0. I feared I'd be languishing behind everyone else and be embarrassed by that. Fortunately my experience saved me from that fate. But then I sometimes found myself getting a little unnecessarily competitive. Where I wanted my projects to impress people more than others in the hope that I'd be the best in the cohort. To what end I don't know. I'm not proud of that feeling, and it's not something I want. It's certainly not how I feel most of the time, but I do have those feelings and thoughts.</li>
          <li><strong>Certainty</strong> - I have at times fought with the uncertainty of what is to come in the next sprint. I believe I've blogged earlier about my default position being one of panic. To automatically decide within myself that I can't do this. That it's too hard and I'm fooling myself. Despite the growing evidence (thus far) to the contrary, I still have that feeling though it does seem slightly more diluted than in the past. Slightly.</li>
          <li><strong>Autonomy</strong> - During Phase 0 I've done my best to counter stress by tacking the work head on. It's fair to say that Phase 0 has a wealth of glorious autonomy. I do have some anxiety about the same during Phase 1 since the schedule is more prescriptive.</li>
          <li><strong>Relatedness</strong> - I think, because we are all in this together and only for a relatively short time there's a great sense of camaraderie in our cohort. I've said it before and I'll say it again, we have a top-notch group of Hihi and I'm genuinely thrilled about that. So I truly feel that everyone is a friend. So far. Watch yourself ;-)</li>
          <li><strong>Fairness</strong> - Since we're all on the same curriculum it's certainly fair. I've felt a little guilty at times because I have more experience than others, but it hasn't taken long before we're all at pretty much the same point. Makes me wish I signed up for EDA months ago.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go?</h3>
        <p>I hate this stuff, always have. No matter how delicately or diplomatically I approach difficult conversations, there's often something out of the blue that I didn't expect or anticipate. I'm a terrible debater. I'd generally just rather let the other person feel that they have the upper hand just so I can leave. It's an area of my life that could do with a helluva lot of polish. Actually, reading this chapter has inspired me to read that famous 'win friends and influence people' book. If it's not already obvious, I didn't have a difficult conversation with anyone.</p>
