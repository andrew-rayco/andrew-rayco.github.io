        <h1>Motivation</h1>

        <h3>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
        <p>I'm going to be honest and say I don't really understand the question. How does life look? The 'pleasure, passion and higher purpose' honestly makes it look simple. Too simple? I don't know. Maybe things really are that simple and I just haven't figured that out yet.</p>
        <p>It certainly made sense to me that we could more easily achieve sustainable happiness if we reverse the seemingly natural priorities of pleasure first, passion second and higher purpose last.</p>
        <p>I understand that a strong focus on ones higher purpose is much more likely to make one happy. Not only do I understand the same about passion (see: flow), but I have signed up for EDA on this exact basis. I experience flow when coding more than anything else. So this concept felt very familiar to me when I learned of it in Sprint one or two. I think the difficulty for me (and I suspect most others) is knowing or discovering what your higher purpose is.</p>
        <p>I was disappointed yet unsurprised to learn that pleasure from short term thrills only provides short term happiness.</p>

        <h3>From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
        What are your core values?</h3>
        <p>You know, I really struggled with this. Many of these exercises have made me realise that I don't really know myself very well. I certainly don't have a very clear connection between my physical and emotional states. Or rather, I lack the ability to recognise them.</p>
        <p>I've always felt strongly about the importance of being nice, so I guess that's a core value. I passionately feel that society has a duty to protect and care for those that cannot care for themselves, so naturally I find Trump's presidency difficult to deal with. I'm anything but selfless, but it pains me that so many are so comfortable looking after nobody but themselves and theirs.</p>
        <p>I believe we have a responsibility to live more environmentally sustainable lifestyles, yet I'm happy to concede I could do much much more to do so myself.</p>

        <h3>What do you stand for?</h3>
        <p>I stand for kindness. Consideration of others. Smiling and saying hello at those you pass on a quiet street. I stand for people over profit. Honest debate. Local, national and global sustainability.</p>

        <h3>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</h3>
        <p>I've heard most if not all those resilience quotes from well-meaning OPs on reddit or facebook. I find they do motivate me and help to reassure myself when I'm feeling faily, but that reassurance is short-lived. Still, this sort of thing can only be positive if reinforced. I'm just glad the book didn't have those quotes laid over a picture of a beautiful sunset.</p>
        <p>As alluded to above, I can't seem to easily recognise the connection between emotions and physical sensations, so I struggled with the exercise. I noticed no physical sensation when recalling either failure or success. It was interesting, however, to note that I found it all too easy to conjure up failure memories, but struggled to find any for success. That's the 3:1 negative:positive ratio doing it's thang right there. I am most willing and eager to learn optimism and unlearn pessimism, so that is something I'll be thinking about a lot when I'm feeling negative.</p>
