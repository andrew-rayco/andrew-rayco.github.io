<h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
<p>If the question is about my approach, I think to get the most out of it I need to go in entirely vulnerable. I expect to get a lot of things wrong. I'll come across walls that will feel impassable, but I have to think back on all those impassable walls I passed to get this far. I'm going to be asking for help <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.nz/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>, and freely offering help where I can. </p>

<p>I really embrace doing this as part of a group, which is at odds with my introvertist tendencies. I've been tinkering for a while alone and not only can I really see the practical benefits of learning together, but it's also going to be rad just talking about coding with someone else who's into it. There's so many new words in my vocab that I haven't even said out loud yet.</p>


<h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
<p>It's obviously a bit early to know of course, but first impressions are positive. Maybe we'll be asked this every week. Felt great to finally kick off and to start meeting fellow Hihi. We're going to go through a lot together.</p>

<h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
<p>I see myself apologising a lot and bumping into things. To be honest though I don't really know. I enjoy a casual relaxed environment where I can have fun while I work/learn. That's one of the reasons I love the idea of working as a coder, the work environment can often find that balance between fun and professional. With that in mind I'll probably attempt the odd quip. I'll laugh at yours if you laugh at mine?</p>
<p>I plan to be vocal when I'm stuck and I hope to be able to help others who get stuck.</p>

<h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
<p>I think it might be too soon to answer this. Or no, they haven't.</p>
<p>What are my expectations? That I'll be challenged, inundated, and somewhat battered. I'd be disappointed if I wasn't. I also expect to make good friends of fellow hihi (shared experiences and all that) and teachers alike.</p>
<p>I expect to finish up with the practical skills to be employable as a full stack developer, although front end has my heart. I expect to have enough confidence in my ability (and ability to learn) that I won't feel like an imposter when I land a coding gig. I expect help in learning how to disregard those kind of unhelpful thoughts.</p>

<h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
<p>Yes, and yes.</p>
<p>I'm definitely excited. Is it just me or did February 20 take aaaages to roll around?</p>
<p>Nervous? Me? Hella yeah. At times I've experienced both of the two fears that Shereef spoke of in his <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat</a>. Am I smart enough? The right kind of smart? Can I endure the intensity? Will I get enough out of the course to justify the investment? My mind has compiled list after list of potential areas of humiliation (I'm looking at you, yoga). I hate the thought of presenting or speaking as part of a group. It's not something I've ever wanted or enjoyed. This whole shebang is going to be HARD, but damned if I'm not as hungry for the challenge as I am the hopeful outcome. Am I nervous? You bet your blog-reading arse I am.</p>
