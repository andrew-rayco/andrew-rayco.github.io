        <h1>Reflection</h1>

        <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
        <p>I originally struggled with this question. It turns out it was because I was missing some waffle cards and I did this task before I read about the effectiveness of reflection as a learning tool. Now I have a better understanding why we're doing
          this. I left the original stuff below because, well, I went to the trouble to write it. So if it seems a bit here and there, that'd be why.</p>

        <p>In short, I love the DBC/EDA approach. Reading about reflection practices in schooling made me realise how incorrectly I've always viewed the art of learning. Although I have some ingrained lifelong scepticism, I particularly welcome the body/mind/soul
          approach to learning, and learning about oneself. Taking this bootcamp is a new chapter for me (as I'm sure it is for most of us Hihi), so I'm completely open in my mind, heart and soul (as much as I know how to be).</p>

        <p>I really embrace doing this as part of a group, which is at odds with my introvertist tendencies. I've been tinkering for a while alone and not only can I really see the practical benefits of learning together, but it's also going to be rad just
          talking about coding with someone else who's into it. There's so many new words in my vocab that I haven't even said out loud yet.</p>

        <p>If the question is about my approach, I think to get the most out of it I need to go in entirely vulnerable. I expect to get a lot of things wrong. I'll come across walls that will feel impassable, but I have to think back on all those impassable
          walls I passed to get this far. I'm going to be asking for help <a href="http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.co.nz/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html">alot</a>, and freely offering help where I can.</p>

        <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
        <p>First impressions are positive. Maybe we'll be asked this every week. It felt great to finally kick off and to start meeting fellow Hihi. We're going to go through a lot together.</p>

        <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
        <p>I see myself apologising a lot and bumping into things. To be honest though I don't really know. I enjoy a casual relaxed environment where I can have fun while I work/learn. That's one of the reasons I love the idea of working as a coder, the
          work environment can often find that balance between fun and professional. With that in mind I'll probably attempt the odd quip. I'll laugh at yours if you laugh at mine?</p>
        <p>I plan to be vocal when I'm stuck and I hope to be able to help others who get stuck. I have a lifelong history of staying quiet when I don't understand something in case I look dim. Now I plan on looking dim regularly so I can best reduce the
          dimness. Dimnity? Damn it. I don't know.</p>

        <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
        <p>I think it might be too soon to answer this. Or no, they haven't.</p>
        <p>What are my expectations? That I'll be challenged, inundated, and somewhat battered. I'd be disappointed if I wasn't. I also expect to make good friends of fellow hihi (shared experiences and all that) and teachers alike.</p>
        <p>I expect to finish up with the practical skills to be employable as a full stack developer, although front end has my heart. I expect to have enough confidence in my ability (and ability to learn) that I won't feel like an imposter when I land
          a coding gig. I expect help in learning how to disregard those kind of unhelpful thoughts.</p>

        <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
        <p>Yes, and yes.</p>
        <p>I'm definitely excited. Is it just me or did February 20 take aaaages to roll around?</p>
        <p>Nervous? Me? Hella yeah. At times I've experienced both of the two fears that Shereef spoke of in his <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014">Fireside Chat</a>. Am I smart enough? The right kind of smart? Can I endure the intensity? Will I get enough
          out of the course to justify the investment? My mind has compiled list after list of potential areas of humiliation (I'm looking at you, yoga). I hate the thought of presenting or speaking as part of a group. It's not something I've ever wanted
          or enjoyed. This whole shebang is going to be HARD, but damned if I'm not as hungry for the challenge as I am the hopeful outcome. Am I nervous? You bet your blog-reading arse I am.</p>

        <h4>Reflection on Friday</h4>
        <p>The course notes seem to be really hammering home the idea of reflection as an effective method of learning. I didn't know that. Very interesting. I'm immediately looking for ways to take advantage of that.</p>

        <p>It's become clear to me now why we were asked to write this blog. Due to the great Hihi waffle shemozzle of 2017, I seemingly did some tasks in the wrong order, writing my blog before reading about reflection. Gotta scoot, pomodoro timer just
          went off.</p>

        <p class="quote">Many of us grow up thinking of mistakes as bad, viewing errors as evidence of fundamental incapacity. This negative thinking pattern can create a self-fulfilling prophecy, which undermines the learning process. To maximize our learning it is essential
          to ask: "How can we get the most from every mistake we make?"

        <p>This part here made me feel particularly good about meditation:</p>
        <p class="quote">Meditation has also been shown to diminish age-related effects on gray matter and reduce the decline of our cognitive functioning.
          <span>— <a href="https://blog.bufferapp.com/how-meditation-affects-your-brain">How meditation affects your brain</a>.</span></p>
        <p>I've spent a lot of time lately wondering about the effect of age has on learning, so this is nice.</p>
