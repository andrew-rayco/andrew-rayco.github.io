        <h1>Meditation process</h1>

        <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
        <p>I'm going to have to be honest here and say that I really could've done a better job of sticking with the 'process over product' idea. Beyond the rudimentary wireframe sketches and even more rudimentary sitemap plan, I totally failed to put the
          process over the product.</p>
        <p>That is something I clearly need to learn. I just can't help but put the product first. I struggle with knowing when to stop. I don't want this to come across as painfully self-delusional or cocky because it's really not meant that way but I have
          found myself, when trying to style a site to my liking, wondering how does a painter know when a painting is finished? There's always something that I want to nudge or resize.</p>
        <p>That 80/20 rule certainly holds true at times. I spent much more time on the responsive navigation itself than the whole layout. I spent much more time changing colours and spacing than I did coding the wireframe into existence. It was an interesting
          exercise to have a six hour timebox to rebuild the site, as I've only ever done such things with no time limit. On the whole I'm really pleased with what I was able to produce in six hours (and, ahem, 45 minutes), but I suspect I really didn't
          learn what I was supposed to learn from this exercise, because damned if I was going to leave it like it was at the six hour limit.</p>
        <p>At this point though I would like to revisit the habit for sprint 3. Fun. I had an absolute ball zhuzhing this site, and it's reaffirmed my desire to want to do this for a job. Admittedly, it's unlikely that in a paid position I'd have the creative
          freedom to nudge things as I want, but I certainly know that I take great satisfaction from making things look and feel lovely. May they always be my kind of lovely.</p>

        <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
        <p>I think the more I read about it the more convinced I become. Like so many things, it make me wish I had started it a long time ago. I could be a guru now :)</p>

        <h3>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
        <p>I was pleasantly, well, pleased by the fact that catching your attention slipping away and encouraging it back is the part where growth occurs. That's really helpful to not think negative thoughts about my mindfulness/attention skill.</p>

        <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
        <p>Surprisingly I kind of liked the 'sitting like a mountain' business. This book and the headspace app that I'm using are happily quite well aligned. I feel like I'm learning more from this book about how to improve.</p>
