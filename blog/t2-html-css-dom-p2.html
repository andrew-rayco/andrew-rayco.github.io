      <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid based design uses a combination of rows and columns to layout a page structure. The grid can vary depending on the desired layout, both site-wide and on a row by row basis. Commonly a 12 column layout is used as 12 can be divisible by 1, 2, 3 and 4 so it allows for flexibility.</p>

      <h3>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>Given the wide variety of web-accessible devices nowadays, webpages need to be flexible enough to accommodate screens of all sizes. A device-agnostic, responsive site or app will ensure acceptable usability, whatever the display size.</p>

      <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic structure means applying meaningful markup to content. Elements are marked up according to their importance (e.g. Headings and paragraphs), or type of content (e.g. lists and images).</p>
      <p>This is particularly important with regards to accessibility (ensuring content is screen-reader friendly) and with delivering effective search engine results.</p>

      <h3>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on</h3>
      <p>I gotta say, I was particularly suprised how easy it is to build your own framework. In hindsight it makes sense, but I have this thing in my mind - this block - where some terms give me the expectation that I won't understand the concept. They <em>sound</em> hard, so my mind convinces itself that it can't be learned... that I've never quite got it. 'Framework' is one of those words. I've known what it means for years, but never quite trusted my ability to know it.</p>
