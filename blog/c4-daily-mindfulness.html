        <h1>Daily Mindfulness</h1>
        <h3>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? </h3>
        <p>I learned that it was a valuable exercise for both myself and my partner. It became difficult to maintain attention when some neighbours began a loud discussion, perhaps disagreement, that was potentially juicy. Otherwise, I was pleased with my ability to retain attention, but I noticed that it's  too rare that I can provide not even three minutes of full attention normally. I think we'll try this regularly.</p>

        <h3>How did the other person find it?</h3>
        <p>She initially felt a little under pressure being the speaker, and struggled to think of something to talk about. She said it's like being asked to 'say something in German'. When you have all the words to choose from, you can't find any.</p>
        <p>She enjoyed having my undivided attention for a whopping three minutes. Lately with my time being largely spent between work and EDA I haven't been giving my partner as much attention as either of us would like, but this was to be expected with the bootcamp.</p>

        <h3>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
        <p>I've already started taking one (or sometimes even more!) breath a day. Trying to introduce mindfulness into my daily activities away from the sitting meditation has been my challenge for the last week or so. I find it most helpful to calm and relax myself by switching my focus to my breath or just being 'in the moment'.</p>
